# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds support for Markdown format generation in the TeeZeeNator application, which currently only supports Confluence Storage Format. The feature will allow users to choose between two output formats when generating technical specifications, with Markdown being the default and preferred format. Additionally, the system prompt for the LLM will be modified to include specific escaping requirements for Markdown content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of TeeZeeNator, I want to choose between Confluence Storage Format and Markdown format when generating technical specifications, so that I can work with the format that best suits my documentation workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the generation interface THEN the system SHALL display format selection options with Confluence Storage Format and Markdown
2. WHEN the format selector is initialized THEN the system SHALL preselect Markdown as the preferred default format
3. WHEN the user selects a format THEN the system SHALL remember this preference for the current session
4. WHEN the user generates a technical specification THEN the system SHALL produce output in the selected format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user generating technical specifications in Markdown format, I want the system to properly generate clean Markdown content, so that I can directly use the output in my documentation systems without additional processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Markdown format is selected THEN the system SHALL generate valid Markdown syntax
2. WHEN generating Markdown THEN the system SHALL avoid inline HTML or proprietary syntax not supported in standard Markdown
3. WHEN generating Markdown content THEN the system SHALL include all required sections from the template pattern
4. WHEN generating Markdown content THEN the system SHALL maintain proper heading hierarchy and formatting
5. WHEN the generation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the Markdown content in a readable format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the LLM to follow strict formatting rules when generating Markdown content, so that the output is consistent and properly escaped for further processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system sends a request to the LLM for Markdown generation THEN the system SHALL include specific escaping requirements in the system prompt
2. WHEN the LLM generates Markdown content THEN it SHALL surround the content with @@@START@@@ and @@@END@@@ markers
3. WHEN the LLM generates content THEN it SHALL NOT add any comments before, after, or between the escape markers except for the actual Markdown payload
4. WHEN the LLM completes generation THEN it SHALL NOT write anything after the @@@END@@@ marker

Example expected output format:
```
@@@START@@@
# Technical Specification
## 1. User Story
Some markdown content here.
@@@END@@@
```

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the TeeZeeNator application, I want the format selection to be properly integrated with the existing template system, so that both formats can utilize the same template patterns with appropriate transformations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects Markdown format THEN the system SHALL use the existing template content and convert it to appropriate Markdown system prompts
2. WHEN a user selects Confluence format THEN the system SHALL continue to use the existing HTML-based system prompts
3. WHEN the system processes templates THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with both format types
4. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL apply format-specific transformations to the template content
